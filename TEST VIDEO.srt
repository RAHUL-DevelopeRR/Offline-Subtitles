00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
(Music playing)

2
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:14,400
High in the trees, one mammal gets about without touching the ground.

3
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:21,700
(Music playing)

4
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:28,160
A Siberian squirrel.
(Music playing)

5
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:29,700
can glide.

6
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:36,200
(Music playing)

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,200
Remembering stretches from its wrists to its ankles.

8
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:02,340
(Music playing)

9
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:12,140
there could hardly be a more efficient way of traveling.
(Music playing)

10
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:18,400
At this time of the year, the female squirrels are not only feeding for themselves.

11
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:26,400
(Music playing)

12
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:28,800
They're awesome.

13
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:31,300
raising families.
(Music playing)

14
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:40,300
A disused woodpecker's nest hole protects the young squirrels from the sub-zero temperature.

15
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:47,600
Their mother's precious milk must sustain them throughout the winter.

16
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:51,420
(Music playing)

17
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:57,000
Five weeks later... The warmth of spring has transformed the forests.

18
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,840
(Music playing)

19
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:03,400
It's time for the young squirrels to leave the shelter of their nest.

20
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:06,980
But the first planets are somewhat daunting.

21
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:09,020
(Music playing)

22
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
You
(Music playing)

23
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,400
One of the youngsters seems keen.
(Music playing)

24
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,940
And one... Not quite so confident.
(Music playing)

25
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:31,200
The first climbs up the tree. Well, the other watches.

26
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
The higher up they go, the further they will glide.

27
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:46,940
And then...
(Music playing) Yes, guys.
(Music playing)

28
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:47,500
Made it.

29
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:56,620
But the other seems to have pre-flight nerves.

(Bird singing)

30
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,500
Perhaps you'll try.

31
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:04,100
Tomorrow
(Music playing)

32
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:08,580
